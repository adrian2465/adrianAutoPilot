=====
HINT: To find config.txt with boot parameters, mount /mmt/mmblk0p1
Then you will find config.txt.
You do not need to use filetool.sh to persist these changes - they will persist.

=====
HINT: To SSH to tc with unknown host/cert, use:
ADDR="192.168.86.179"
echo "Use ~. to disconnect."
echo "Using address $ADDR"
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no tc@$ADDR

=====
NOTE: To persist changes to bootlocal.sh, use "filetool.sh -b"

HOWTO: Enable i2c (mpu9250 GPS)
* You will need tce package i2c-tools
* You will probably have to manually create the i2c device:
  sudo modprobe i2c-dev
* Now you should have /dev/i2c-1
If you run
$ sudo i2cdetect -y 1
you will get a hexdump with a number in it.

=====
Installing smbus
* Install make
* Install gcc
* install compiletc
* install python3.10-dev

* pip install smbus


=====
Reading the MPU:
* Run as ROOT
* from smbus import SMBus
* from gps import *
* i2cbus = SMBus(1)
* i2caddr = 0x68 (found using sudo i2cdetect -y 1)
* gpsd = gps(mode=WATCH_ENABLE|WATCH_NEWSTYLE)
* i2cbus.read_byte(i2c_address)
