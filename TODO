TODOs
o Uninstall: 
  * make
  * gcc 
  * compiletc
  * python3-dev?
which were needed for pip-based installation of smbus (pip install smbus)

o 2023-04-12 - Re-flash arduino with updated C code.
o 2023-04-12 - In arduinoInterface test.  Add 'debug' (e=1) to testing.
o 2023-04-12 - I'm thinking that methods that are not simply internal properties should be named get_xxx and set_xxx.
o 2023-04-12 - Fix brain, etc., which probably broke overhauling the arduinointerface.
o 2023-04-12 - Make sure send_to_arduino and receive_from_arduino still work!! 
o 2023-04-12 - Potentially, add tests for parameter messups.  l123, etc.
o 2023-04-12 - In YAML, move gains under 'brain'. Re-label 'boat_characteristics' to just 'boat'
o 2023-04-12 - Potentially, label test boat parameters "testboat"
o 2023-04-12 - MAYBE: I'm also thinking to change e= to mean debug mode. Major refactor, as it would mean maintaining state in the program instead of arduino. and that the only things reported in non-debug mode would be p and (exceptionally) m and x.

DONEs
x 2023-03-04 - Archive working configuration in $HOME. "home_date.tar"
x 2023-03-04 - Get PI talking to Arduino via serial interface
x 2023-03-04 - Migrate Python code for simulator to micropython
x 2023-04-12 - Remove extra newline from write in arduinoInterface - shouldn't need it. If we do, why?
