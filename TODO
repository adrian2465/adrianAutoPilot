TODOs
o LEFT OFF HERE. Not moving the motor even though off course

Also, interface status is showing r=1, l=-1, s=undefined, d=undefined, x=undefined on web page.
o Uninstall: 
  * make
  * gcc 
  * compiletc
  * python3-dev?
which were needed for pip-based installation of smbus (pip install smbus)

o 2023-08-28 - Add easy-to-find, interactive calibration program that finds rudder limits, allows setting of gains, etc. Persist (perhaps) in config.yaml, or overwrite with calibrations.yaml

DONEs
DONE o 2023-08-28 - Add rudder sense device to board, and test and calibrate
x 2023-08-24 - How will you translate rudder angle (-1 <= 0 <= 1) to motor speed and duration?  Figure the motor duration as a percentage of hard over angle vs rudder speed. NOTE: Will be handled by brain, which will check frequently and stop the motor when the angle is correct.
x 2023-03-04 - Archive working configuration in $HOME. "home_date.tar"
x 2023-03-04 - Get PI talking to Arduino via serial interface
x 2023-03-04 - Migrate Python code for simulator to micropython
x 2023-04-12 - Remove extra newline from write in arduinoInterface - shouldn't need it. If we do, why?
DONE 2023-05-23 - In the middle of adding setters to the PID values.
DONE 2023-04-12 - Make sure send_to_arduino and receive_from_arduino still work!!
DONE 2023-04-12 - Re-flash arduino with updated C code.
DONE 2023-04-12 - In arduinoInterface test.  Add 'debug' (e=1) to testing.
DONE 2023-04-12 - I'm thinking that methods that are not simply internal properties should be named get_xxx and set_xxx.
DONE 2023-08-24 - !! Push development branch from laptop to GIT
DONE 2023-08-24 - pid_controller appears to be working. Push the development branch.
DONE 2023-04-12 - Fix brain, etc., which broke overhauling the controller.
DONE 2023-08-27 - Code-Review the places that use the Config object.  Overhaul list:
  - SKIP ./web/autopilotWebApp.py - NOTE: Will need rewrite when brain is done.
  - DONE ./web/modules/brain.py NOTE: Not done so much, but I'm rewriting the brain, so CR is now obsolete.
  - DONE (DELETED) ./web/modules/sensor.py
  - SKIP (DO WE NEED THIS?) ./web/modules/calibration/mpu9360-calibration.py
  - SKIP ./web/modules/imuInterface.py

  - DONE ./web/modules/boat.py
  - DONE ./web/modules/anglemath.py
