TODOs
o Uninstall: 
  * make
  * gcc

which were needed for pip-based installation of smbus (pip install smbus)

o 2023-04-12 - Re-flash arduino with updated C code.
o 2023-04-12 - In arduinoInterface test.  Add 'echo' (e=1) to testing.
o 2023-04-12 - Remove extra newline from write in arduinoInterfacde - shouldn't need it. If we do, why?
o 2023-04-12 - Fix brain, etc., which probably broke overhauling the arduinointerface.
o 2023-04-12 - Make sure send_to_arduino and receive_from_arduino still work!! 
o 2023-04-12 - Potentially, add tests for parameter messups.  l123, etc.
